[Play the game here!](https://phrasegame.shanjiang.ca)
This is a game I made as part of a school project. The game starts you off at a passphrase login screen, and has several bookmarks at the top of the screen. These bookmarks bring you to sites that play with the player's expectation of normal websites. For example, one site subverts the scroll progress indicators common in many news sites to bring a fun twist. Each site is a puzzle, which when solved, gives a word. Solve all of the puzzles, and you can return to the login screen and enter the passphrase to win.
Each site has a hint system, with two hints and a solution given to players who can't quite figure it out.



## Process
I made this game in about two weeks, using mostly vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. The site is hosted as a static site on Vercel, with an API proxy to make the Wordle site work. For the victory screen, I used Matter.js to create a small physics sandbox.
